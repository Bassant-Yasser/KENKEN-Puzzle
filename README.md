# Kenken Puzzle

The goal of this project is to create a software that solves the KENKEN puzzle, here you can learn about the rules of the game.
This is a constrain satisfaction problem (CSP), and you are required to implement and analyze the performance of the three algorithms of CSP:

* Backtracking
* Backtracking with forward checking
* Backtracking with arc consistency
